My name is Usman Aamir, and I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Software Enginnering from Fast NUCES.
I am a flexible person who can easily switch from being an introvert and outgoing, and adjust to the people around me. This adaptability allows me to connect with new people around me.
One of the driving forces in my life is my natural curiosity, which fuels my love for travel. Traveling provides me the opportunity to visit new places, immense myself in different culture and adopt new perspectives. Each journey is a chance to learn something new and explore more about it. These experiences enhances my understanding of the world.
